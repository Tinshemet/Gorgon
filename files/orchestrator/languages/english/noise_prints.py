"""THE NOISE PRINT CATALOGUE — the declared ways a word gets corrupted on its way to us.

⇒ WHY A CATALOGUE AND NOT A FUZZY MATCHER (operator, 2026-09-07)

Denoising is not deciphering. A cipher guarantees a plaintext and is invertible by construction;
noise DESTROYS information, COMPOSES several corruptions at once, and may have no coherent original
at all — the person may have been confused, or changed their mind mid-sentence. So an edit-distance
threshold answers the wrong question. "Is this within two edits of `running`?" is a similarity
score. The question that licenses a repair is: **is the difference explained by corruptions we have
declared?** A print that is not in this catalogue is not a near miss to be tolerated — it is the
signal to ASK.

That makes the catalogue's real output a trichotomy, and it is the same one ROUTE emits:
    every edit explained  → the repair has EVIDENCE, and the prints are the evidence
    an edit unexplained   → we cannot read it → ASK, naming what we could not account for
    (and the caller refuses when two candidates are both explained — ambiguity is never resolved
     here; see `explain_all`.)

⇒ DERIVED FROM MEASURED NOISE, NOT INVENTED. Every print below was mined from 1,766 held-out and
tuned marathon turns (1,157 corrupted tokens explained). The share each carries is recorded on it.
The largest single family was MIXED at 27% — real corruptions compose — which is why this module
explains a word EDIT BY EDIT rather than matching whole-word shapes. A composition of declared
prints is itself declared; a composition containing one undeclared edit is not.

CASE is deliberately absent: a case-mangled token still matches case-insensitively, so it never
blocks recognition and needs no print.
